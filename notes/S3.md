## AWS S3 Overview

What is Object Storage (Object-based Storage)?

Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects as opposed to other storage architectures.

- S3 provides you with \*unlimited storage.
- You donâ€™t need to think about the underlying infrastructure (Server-less)
- The S3 Console provides an interface for users to upload and access your data.

### S3 Objects

Objects contain data. They are like files, Objects may consist of:

- **Key**: The name of the Object.
- **Value**: The data itself is made up of a sequence of bytes.
- **Version ID**: when versioning is enabled, a snapshot of the object over time.
- **Metadata**: additional information attached to the object

### S3 Buckets

Buckets hold Objects, Buckets can also have folders which in turn hold objects.

- S3 is a universal namespace so Buckets must have unique names similar to domain names.
- You can store individual Objects from 0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes in size.
